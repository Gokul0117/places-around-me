                The Thanjavur Big Temple or Thanjavur Brihadeeswarar Temple, is one of the unsung world wonders with many 
              unknown architectural secrets that still keeps the people excited after 1000 years. There are boundless wonders 
              inside the Thanjavur Temple, which will definitely realign the list of world wonders in the upcoming days. 
              It is one of the most attractive tourist places in Tamil Nadu which makes people from other countries 
              know about the Chola Kingdom and their advanced architectural mind. The most surprising factor is that the 
              shadow of the vimana or kalasam of the Thanjavur temple will not fall on the ground. It is still a mystery 
              for the researchers how the shadow is not falling
